# Puzzle Solver :
## ðŸ‘ˆ Solve Puzzles using Deep Learning networks and AutoEncoders  
![Puzzle > Solution](https://github.com/Avkash/mldl/blob/master/images/puzzle-info.png?raw=true)

## ðŸ‘ˆ What you need
- You need a the shuffle block image and a solution image to use this demo. 
- The shuffle image will be used as training data
- The solution image will be used a test data

## ðŸ‘ˆ How it works
- The solution image will split into the blocks same as provided into shuffle image
- The neural networks will be developed to find the closest block from the training data to match with solution block
- The resultset will be the ordered list of block from training images to solve the puzzle
- Using the order list of block, the final solution image is generated from the blocks of shuffle image
