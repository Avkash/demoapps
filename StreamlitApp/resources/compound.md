# How does calculation works

## What we need? 
- Principal Investment Sum or Amount (Lets call it - P/r)
- Annual Interest Rate (Lets call it - R/r)
- Total Years (Lets call it - N/n)
- Annualy means 1 time a year/Monthly means 12 times in a year

## Mathematical Function
- Principal + Interest (CI) = P(1+R/N)^nt
- For montly calculation the rate R is calculated as R/100
- Here nt is configured as:
  - t = Time in years, 6 months means 0.5 years
  - n = number of compounding periods per unit t 
    - Yearly  > 1
    - Monthly > 12
